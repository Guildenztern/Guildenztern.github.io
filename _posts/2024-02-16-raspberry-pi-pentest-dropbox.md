## Raspberry Pi Penetration Testing Dropbox

This will be the blog post for my pentest dropbox that I used on a recent personal project. Do not need GUI for this to work, so long as the WiFi and configs are preset properly.

### Hardware, Software, and Accounts Used

This section will list the Hardware and Software that I used while creating and configuring my pentest dropbox.

#### Hardware

* Raspberry Pi 4 (link) - This is the actual pentest dropbox that will be planted on-site. 
* Remote Attack Box - This is the machine that you will use to connect to the Raspberry Pi once the dropbox has been placed on-site. Windows or Linux can work for this purpose; I opted for another Kali machine as my Attack Box
* Micro-HDMI cable and monitor - Used for initial Raspberry Pi setup
* 

#### Software

* <a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/arm/raspberry-pi-4/"> Kali Linux for the Pi4 </a>
* Software Lists

#### Accounts

Accounts (AWS, Lightsail, EC2, etc)

### **Future Efforts**

This section will list where I think I can improve on this efort for future iterations.

#### Configure as a WiFi Access Point for other pentest tools

Purpose/use: Don't want to connect so many devices to the target network. Just plant Pi Dropbox and then connect everything else to that dropbox.

ConOps.

#### Bash Commands Tester

```bash
wget https://git.io/vpn -O openvpn-install.sh
chmod +x ./openvpn-install.sh
./openvpn-install.sh

scp -i cloud_server_key ubuntu@cloud_server_hostname:~/raspberry_box.ovpn ./
scp -i cloud_server_key ubuntu@cloud_server_hostname:~/attack_box.ovpn ./

openvpn raspberry_box.ovpn
openvpn attack_box.ovpn

cp ./raspberry_box.ovpn /etc/openvpn/openvpn.conf
systemctl enable openvpn
```

#### Config File Edit Test

```bash
This is a tester for a config file from CLI.
```

#### Text File Tester

```txt
This is a tester for a text file edit, with no code highlighting.
```
