## Raspberry Pi Penetration Testing Implant

![Stock Pi4 Placeholder](https://soldered.com/productdata/2019/09/dsc01864_2.jpg)

This will be the blog post for my pentest implant device that I used on a recent personal project. Do not need GUI for this to work, so long as the WiFi and configs are preset properly.

### Hardware, Software, and Accounts Used

This section will list the Hardware and Software that I used while creating and configuring my pentest dropbox.

#### Hardware

* <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/"> Raspberry Pi 4 8GB </a> - This is the actual pentest dropbox that will be planted on-site.
* Remote Attack Box - This is the machine that you will use to connect to the Raspberry Pi once the dropbox has been placed on-site. Windows or Linux can work for this purpose; I opted for another Kali machine as my Attack Box
* Micro-HDMI cable and monitor - Used for initial Raspberry Pi setup

#### Software

* <a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/arm/raspberry-pi-4/"> Kali Linux for the Pi4 </a>

#### Other Requirements

* <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/"> AWS EC2 </a> -  free tier will be sufficient for this application

### **Phase 1**: Connecting the Raspberry Pi to target WiFi automatically on system startup

Description of the pre-reqs, purpose, and steps of this phase.

**Step 1:** Create the new ```wpa_supplicant.conf``` file and place it in the correct directory

Log into Kali on the Pi (default username:password are kali:kali). Open a Terminal and run ```sudo su``` to become root.

Run the command ```touch wpa_supplicant.conf``` to create a new file. Edit the new config file to read:

```
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
country=US
update_config=1
network=
{
                   ssid=”SSID_NAME”
                   psk=”Wifi_Password”
}
```

**Note:** Replace "SSID_NAME" and "Wifi_Password" with the SSID and pass of your target WiFi network (this information will have to be gathered from other reconnaissance or social engineering efforts).

Once the ```wpa_supplicant.conf``` file has been created run ```mv ./wpa_supplicant.conf /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf``` to place it in the correct directory location.

**Step 2:** Edit the interfaces file

Navigate to ```/etc/network``` and edit the ```interfaces``` file.

### **Future Efforts**

This section will list where I think I can improve on this efort for future iterations.

#### Configure as a WiFi Access Point for other pentest tools

Purpose/use: Don't want to connect so many devices to the target network. Just plant Pi Dropbox and then connect everything else to that dropbox.

ConOps.

#### Bash Commands Tester

```bash
wget https://git.io/vpn -O openvpn-install.sh
chmod +x ./openvpn-install.sh
./openvpn-install.sh

scp -i cloud_server_key ubuntu@cloud_server_hostname:~/raspberry_box.ovpn ./
scp -i cloud_server_key ubuntu@cloud_server_hostname:~/attack_box.ovpn ./

openvpn raspberry_box.ovpn
openvpn attack_box.ovpn

cp ./raspberry_box.ovpn /etc/openvpn/openvpn.conf
systemctl enable openvpn
```

#### Config File Edit Test

```bash
This is a tester for a config file from CLI.
```

#### Text File Tester

```txt
This is a tester for a text file edit, with no code highlighting.
```
