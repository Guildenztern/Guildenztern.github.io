## Building a Raspberry Pi Penetration Testing Dropbox

This will be the blog post for my pentest dropbox that I used on a recent personal project.

### Hardware, Software, and Accounts

This section will list the Hardware and Software that I used

#### Hardware

Hardware Lists

#### Software

Software Lists

#### Accounts

Accounts (AWS, Lightsail, EC2, etc)

#### Some T-SQL Code

```tsql
SELECT This, [Is], A, Code, Block -- Using SSMS style syntax highlighting
    , REVERSE('abc')
FROM dbo.SomeTable s
    CROSS JOIN dbo.OtherTable o;
```

#### Some PowerShell Code

```powershell
Write-Host "This is a powershell Code block";

# There are many other languages you can use, but the style has to be loaded first

ForEach ($thing in $things) {
    Write-Output "It highlights it using the GitHub style"
}
```
